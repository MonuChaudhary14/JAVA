/*

findInLine(String pattern)
This method searches for a pattern (regular expression) in the current line of the input. It returns the matched string if found; otherwise, it returns null.

Scanner scanner = new Scanner("Hello 123 World 456");

        // Find the first occurrence of a number in the line
        String match = scanner.findInLine("\\d+");

         Explanation: The regex \\d+ looks for a number within the first 8 characters (Java 123). Since 123 is within that range, it's returned.


2. findWithinHorizon(String pattern, int horizon)
This method searches for a pattern within the given horizon (character limit). If a match is found, it returns the matched string; otherwise, it returns null.

Scanner scanner = new Scanner("Java 123 Programming 456");

        // Searching for a number within the first 8 characters
        String match = scanner.findWithinHorizon("\\d+", 8);

ðŸ”¹ Explanation: The regex \\d+ looks for a number within the first 8 characters (Java 123). Since 123 is within that range, it's returned.

3. nextBigInteger()
This method reads the next token as a BigInteger. It is useful for handling large integers that exceed long's limit.

Scanner scanner = new Scanner("987654321012345678901234567890");

        BigInteger bigInt = scanner.nextBigInteger();

ðŸ”¹ Explanation: The number is too large for primitive types like long, so we use BigInteger to handle it.

4. nextBigDecimal()
This method reads the next token as a BigDecimal. It is useful for handling very large or precise decimal numbers.

Scanner scanner = new Scanner("12345.678901234567890123456789");

        BigDecimal bigDec = scanner.nextBigDecimal();

        ðŸ”¹ Explanation: BigDecimal is used for high-precision arithmetic, which is useful for financial applications.


5. skip(String pattern)
This method skips over input that matches the given regular expression.

 Scanner scanner = new Scanner("ABC 123 XYZ");

        // Skip the first word (ABC)
        scanner.skip("\\w+");

        // Skip the space
        scanner.skip("\\s+");

        // Read the next integer
        int number = scanner.nextInt();


6.ioException()
This method returns the last IOException encountered by the scanner, or null if no exception has occurred. It's useful for checking whether an I/O error happened during scanning.

Example

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IOExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = null;
        try {
            scanner = new Scanner(new File("non_existent_file.txt"));
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found!");
        }

        if (scanner != null && scanner.ioException() != null) {
            System.out.println("I/O Exception occurred: " + scanner.ioException());
        }

        if (scanner != null) {
            scanner.close();
        }
    }
}

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundException occurs.

ioException() can be checked to detect any I/O errors.
