/*
A CountDownLatch is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes. It is useful for ensuring that a task does not proceed until other required tasks finish.

How Does CountDownLatch Work? ðŸ¤”
Initialize the latch with a count (number of tasks to wait for).

Each thread calls countDown() when it completes its task.

The waiting thread calls await(), which blocks execution until the count reaches zero.

Once count reaches zero, the waiting thread proceeds.

Example: Waiting for Multiple Threads to Finish

import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

class Worker extends Thread {
    private CountDownLatch latch;

    public Worker(CountDownLatch latch, String name) {
        super(name);
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " started.");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulating work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished.");
        latch.countDown(); // Decrements latch count
    }
}

public class CountDownLatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3); // Waiting for 3 tasks

        new Worker(latch, "Worker-1").start();
        new Worker(latch, "Worker-2").start();
        new Worker(latch, "Worker-3").start();

        latch.await(); // Main thread waits for workers to complete
        System.out.println("All workers finished. Main thread proceeding.");
    }
}
Output (Order may vary)

Edit
Worker-1 started.
Worker-2 started.
Worker-3 started.
Worker-1 finished.
Worker-2 finished.
Worker-3 finished.
All workers finished. Main thread proceeding.
âœ… The main thread waits until all workers complete their tasks before continuing.

Use Cases of CountDownLatch
âœ” Waiting for multiple threads to complete before proceeding (e.g., loading resources in a game).
âœ” Ensuring a service starts only after dependent components initialize.
âœ” Testing concurrency by making threads wait before proceeding together.
